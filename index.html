William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems,<br>each fourteen lines long (three
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a>
followed by a rhyming
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).
<strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br> Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br> And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
  </p>
</blockquote>
